# jQuery: AJAX gallery with cache

This is a simple implementation of an AJAX gallery with jQuery where the web storage is used as a local cache for the results.

## Usage

1. Put your images in the `images` folder.
2. Create the MySQL table in your local database by importing the `.sql` file.
3. Run the import script by first making sure that you've entered the correct MySQL connection details. This script is used just for the sake of the example.
4. Enter your MySQL connection details in the AJAX script.
5. Open the main index file and see how it works.
